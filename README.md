## About
The goal of this project is to provide a portable development envirenment that improves communication and remote collaboration while streamlining the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

## Team Members

### Hans: Developer

### Kris Bravo 

### Amy: ? 


## How it works
Currently exploring the following options:
1. Automate the Boring Stuff with a docker container built around puppeteer.
2. Create Custom VS Code Extentions to improve github workflow with a SMART TODO List
3. Create a boilerplate GitPod wrapper companies can use to provide a univseral development environment built on OSS like gitter, etc.

### Requirements to run
1. Just needs docker :-)
2. Just needs VS Code
3. Gitpod just needs a browser :-) 


## Tech stack used (i.e Node, React, Auth0, Jest, etc)
Visual Studio Code, Node.js, React, Ionic, Docker, GitPod


## How to use it (Including set up instructions/requirements, local development)
Hans will publish an extensive tutorial on this subject and include it in the development.
