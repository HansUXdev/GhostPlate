<!-- [![Software Development Life Cycle](CollaborationTemplates/SDLC.drawio.svg)]() -->

## Potential Solutions
<!-- [![Software Development Life Cycle](CollaborationTemplates/Overview.drawio.svg)]() -->

1. The simplest way to help connect others

## How it works
Currently exploring the following options:
1. A simple collection of [VS Code Extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HansBashesMS.covid-working) centered around productivity aka a json file published the absolutely most horribly documented sales pitch for Azure.
2. Automate the Boring Stuff with a docker container built around puppeteer.
2. Create Custom VS Code Extensions to improve github workflow with a SMART TODO List
3. Create a boilerplate GitPod wrapper companies can use to provide a universal development environment built on OSS like gitter, etc.
