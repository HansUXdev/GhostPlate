# RemoteDevCatz
 A modern **development environment** for designers and developers to collaborate remotely by streamlining the software development life cycle.

## Tips for Success
1. Use Your Resources
2. Don't over optimize
3. Focus on the MVP
4. Make a Great Pitch

5. Tips


## About
The goal of this project is to provide a portable development envirenment that improves communication and remote collaboration while streamlining the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

1. The simplest way to help connect others
isn't nessissarly to build an new app that you have to login to. The simplest way to look around at whats wrong

## How it works
Currently exploring the following options:
1. A simple collection of [VS Code Extensions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HansBashesMS.covid-working) centered around productivity aka a json file published the absolutely most horribly documented sales pitch for Azure.
2. Automate the Boring Stuff with a docker container built around puppeteer.
2. Create Custom VS Code Extentions to improve github workflow with a SMART TODO List
3. Create a boilerplate GitPod wrapper companies can use to provide a universal development environment built on OSS like gitter, etc.

### Requirements to run
1. Just needs docker :-)
2. Just needs VS Code
3. Gitpod just needs a browser :-) 


## Tech stack used (i.e Node, React, Auth0, Jest, etc)
Visual Studio Code, Node.js, React, Ionic, Docker, GitPod


## How to use it (Including set up instructions/requirements, local development)
Hans will publish an extensive tutorial on this subject and include it in the development.


### Security Conscious Driven Environments...
Very few developers know anything about security, yet they always seem to assume their app is the most secure thing on the planet...
Here are three basic command
1. Listen to all your ports
   - `lsof -nP +c 15 | grep LISTEN`
2. Find out the process ID (PID) which is occupying the port number (e.g., 5955) you would like to free
  - `sudo lsof -i :5955`
3. Kill the process which is currently using the port using its PID
  - `sudo kill -9 PID`
4. Nuke all non-essential programs on your machine (and your live stream)...
   - `kill -9 -1`
