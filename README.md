## What is GhostPlate?
[![image showing nvm is installed](./911.png)]()

A modern **remote centric** development environment for designers and developers stay connected and collaborate remotely by streamlining the software development life cycle.

---

## Ok, why does it matter to me?
How does this help me communicate with my team?

---

## It does a lot more than that...
Communication isn't a technology issue, it's a social and organizational issue. Trust me, I'm a sociologist who just happens to write code for a living to build emails, websites, apps, and ocationally servers & circuit board when I'm bored...

---

## Ok what does that mean?
Well, basically, I was trying to build a social network inside and IDE to connect designers, develpers, QA, and Project Managers so we all can spend less time in zoom and more time with family during a pandemic...

## Problem(s): Connecting Design & Development
1. The simplest way to help connect others isn't nessissarly to build an new app that you have to login to. 
2. Designer & Developers have always had communication issues


---

## Problem(s): Connecting Design & Development
So lets bring them into our IDE with chat feature, and design functionality...

Such as Responsive Design Tempates

## Problem(s): Connecting Design & Development 2
Or Affinity Maps...

## Problem(s): Traditional Software Development Life Cycle

## Potential Solutions: 
1. Improved Software Development Life Cycle

### 2.Automate the Boring Stuff at Scale
* Crawl your own site, generate styleguide or match that a page conforms to them (or not).
* Screenshot each page, with each modern browser, and also do it by breakpoint
* oh and don't forget to write the console.log as a file so you know what is breaking, and where...

# Clearly it was a bad idea...
and almost gave up...

# Features
1. Built in Collaboration Templates
2. Lightweight & "Frameworkless"
3. Build just about anything (web, server, mobile app and hardware)
4. Build a Car with spare parts
5. "Frameworkless"
6. Build just about anything

## Approaching the problem: 1
Originally, I and the team were exploring the following options in order to giver users more flexibility.

4. Automate the Boring Stuff with around puppeteer, then scale it.
3. Create a boilerplate GitPod wrapper companies can use to provide a universal development environment built on OSS like gitter, etc.

## Approaching the problem: 2
Originally, I and the team were exploring the following options in order to giver users more flexibility.

3. Create Custom VS Code Extensions to improve github workflow with a SMART TODO List ([concept only](Automation/SMART-todo-app.drawio.svg))

## Lightweight & "Frameworkless"
Most of have seen this my now... That's not what this is...
[![image showing nvm is installed](./nocode.png)]()

---

## One Boilerplate for:
* web, 
* server,
* mobile app 
* & hardware

---

## Tools Available:
1. Gatsby & Next for sites
2. Ionic for mobile apps
3. Johnny5 / Tessel 2 - HardWare

---

## Convention or Configuration?
Why not Configuration as convention?
Ghost Plate is built for industry..

Here is an example of the same convention being applied to a learning module...

## GitPod = Production Environment Anywhere
And that also means as a coding teacher, my students don't have to suffer because they have old equipement. I can keep the content modern and all they need is a **browser**...

### Requirements to run
1.  Just needs a browser :-) 

--- 

## Tech stack used (i.e Node, React, Auth0, Jest, etc)
Visual Studio Code, Node.js, React, Ionic, Docker, GitPod, Johny5

---

## How to use it 
I wish it wasn't just mean so I could focus on doing this better... I'd rather not write something here than write a bad tutorial so I'm going to film it.

To Use Ionic there is substial setup that is a bit beyond me
